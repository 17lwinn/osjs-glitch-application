# osjs-glitch-application

## Introduction

This is a **PROOF OF CONCEPT** glitch.com application launcher

I haven't fully discovered the API endpoints yet, so this just works on a very limited level.

*Please note that you may have to run this behind HTTPS in order for most applications to work!*

## Installation

**Not published to npm, use git and place in your distro packages folder instead**

```
npm install osjs-glitch-application
npm run package:discover
```
